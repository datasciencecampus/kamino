Project [Kamino](http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Kamino)
=======================================================

[![Project Status: Active - The project has reached a stable, usable state and is being actively developed.](http://www.repostatus.org/badges/latest/active.svg)](http://www.repostatus.org/#active) [![LICENSE.](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-OGL--3-brightgreen.svg?style=flat)](http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/doc/open-government-licence/version/3/)

The Data Science Campus has been investigating the use of ONS data in developing low area economic information without breaching the legal obligation to protect sensitive data. The level of detail and resolution required in the data, the greater the risk of it being disclosive. This project has explored methods of providing insight into datasets while preserving high resolution of both the geographical areas represented and specificity of the industries considered.

This package contains a Shiny application which consists of two main outputs (a map and a sankey widget) controlled by a panel of selection controls.

The app combines MMO fleet landings data, Companies House register data and The ONS Inter-Departmental Business Register to provide an analysis dashboard for the UK Fishing Industry.

``` r
